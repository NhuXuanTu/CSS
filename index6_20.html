            My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and 1.
            Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow.
            She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her.
            I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. 
            She has a major influence on me and 1 hope that I will inherit some of her traits.

                My first visit to Nha Trang, the coastal city, was three years ago. 
                It was a pleasant and memorable trip. Nha Trang, the capital of Khanhs Hoaf province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of Vietnam.
                In Nha Trang, nature beauties are so tempting. Waves crashing onto the cliffs;
                the soft sigh of the sea breeze; clean white sands and turquoise waters;</li>
